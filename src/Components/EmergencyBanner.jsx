        This project is currently still in progress. If there is an issue or
        have an idea to add please connect me through -
        <a href="https://alexannmill.github.io/portfolio">my site</a> in the
        contact me section. Once live this banner will act as an emergency
        broadcasting. This will alert people of heat waves, cold snaps, spike in
        overdoses and more.
